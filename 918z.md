This question is the extension of the leetcode 53, which is the maximum
of the subarray. The trick of this question is to convert the maximum of the [n- i: n +j] i> 0, j > 0 to the sum - minsubarray. So I need to do two things, one is to compute the maximum and another is the minimum. And to notice that when the maximum is smaller than zero, the best I can return is maximum, instead of the sum -minimum, since it would be zero. 

I made a mistake in this question that I initialize the vairable to the wrong value.

Thus the initialized value should preserve the initial condition of the dp(recursion);
