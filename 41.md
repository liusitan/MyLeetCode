In the first loop, I need to ensure for each position i, nums[i] should equal to i.
For the while, I implemented it as a if at the start of the loop. 
This swap only move the nums[i] to the corresponing place at index nums[i]. However, it does not guarantee that the i is at index i.  will the while loop ends? 
yes, when we can not find a i in the nums, we have either an additional number <= 0 or >n. in the second casse, it will stop the loop. for the first case, if it is zero, it will swap with num[0], if num[0] is zero, then the loop ends, and if the nums[0] is  greater than the n or <0, it will terminate in the next loop. 

since I added zero to the end of the loop at first, the num[0] is guarantee to be zero, 
In the second loop, I look for the slot in the nums that does not meet this targeted invariant of first loop.


TC:
For anyone who doubts on the complexity of this algorithm: just consider position with A[i] = i+1 as a CORRECT SLOT.

CORRECT SLOT will never be changed: for CORRECT SLOT, A[A[i] - 1] always equals to A[i], vice versa (1)
For each swap, the number of CORRECT SLOT increases by at least 1: Position A[A[i] - 1] = A[i] becomes a CORRECT SLOT after swap, and according to (1), this must be a new CORRECT SLOT
The maximum of CORRECT SLOT <= N
Therefore, the complexity is O(N)
