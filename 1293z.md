To have the shortest path between the start point and the end point, and given the limited power point to break the barrier. This could be done with bfs once we consider the the location + the reaminging pp as a state. Then we convert this quetion to from sstarting node to all the end node, how many steps is necessary. Then using bfs, when we traversesd to the end node, it guarantees it has the shortest path. 
Then we skip the edge case first, we have the state xx, and state xx. And the timecomplexity and space complexity is. mnk
